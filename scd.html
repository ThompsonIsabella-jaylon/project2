	<div class="jayloncool"> This graph here shows the rapid increase in homelessness over the years and it is expected to get worse in the coming years. This has been proven to be a crisis in Los Angles and a sad crisis indeed. Kids walk along the streets not to see frienmdly people but people suffering at the cost of America's unfair economical issues. </div>

	<div class="jj1"> One of the many issues that comes with being homeless is health. Homeless people are more prone to diseases beacsue they are leaving outside and rough conditions. There are rarely any bathrooms around or cleaning stations so they there's no way for them to wash their hands allowing for diseases to be spread very easily. Since everyone is in close proximity people catch those same diseases unknowingly and spread them as well. </div>
