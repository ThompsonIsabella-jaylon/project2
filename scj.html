		<div class="box3">  In America there are currently 560,000 people living on the streets without anywhere to go. Most minority groups in the United States are more prone to homelessness as displayed in multiple studies. Most people fall to homelessness because of high housing and apartment prices. The economial structure especially in America can be uunfair and cruel at times. 74% of adult Americans suffered from an addiction in 2017 and 8.5 million Americans had some sort of mental health issue or disorder do to this addiction. Most often this leads to people ending up on the streets where homelessness comes into full effect. </div>
		<div class="box4">  What are the effects of homelessness </div>
		<div class="box5"> Many of the effects of homelessness are evironmental. People who are homeless tend to live on the streets or live around poverty based areas. Just because these people's environmental situation ins't tthe best doesn't mean they are bad people. Many homeless people are looked at against instead of actually being looked at in a empathetic way. These people usually have to eat from trash cans or hope someone is willing to help them get out of their current situation. They are forced to sleep on the streets and use the bathroom in public areas outside which can lead to a spread of diseases. Check out our environmental page to learn more.
